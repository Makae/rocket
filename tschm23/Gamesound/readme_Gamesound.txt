How to install game music:

you need:
- add the GlobalGameController Prefab to your game (provides the soundsource)
- The sound should be 2D sound (heared the same for every distance)
- need the script "MyUnitySingleton"
- set an audio listener on the player or Main Camera (to be able to hear the sound)
